since we are now using multiple nodejs+express applications,
symbolic links to node_modules are being used to reduce the
git log clutter and repo size. this may cause issues on
non-POSIX systems (aka Windows). if this occurs, just copy
_nodejs/node_modules into each of the express application
roots.

a shellscript, run.sh, has been included in order to
spin up all the daemons at once.
